BEWD: FINAL PROJECT
--------

#DESCRIPTION
For the final project you will use your knowledge of back-end web development to produce an awesome web application that can be used by friends, family or any of the other billions of people who use the Internet. You will choose the type of web application you’d like to create. Don’t worry; you have some time to think about what you would like to do.

The objectives:

- Demonstrate understanding of all topics covered during this course.

- Apply knowledge gained during this course by building a web application from the ground up.

The final project encapsulates everything you’ve learned in this course. We want to make sure you are successful in your venture, so to stay on track we suggest you take our milestone suggestions seriously. In addition, we will help define scope and guide you through the process.


##MVP CORE REQUIREMENTS
>**NOTE: Scaffolding is completely prohibited in final projects**

Your minimum viable product must include:

| Requirements | Notes & Resources|
| :----------- | :--------------- |
| A README.md markdown in your app's root directory detailing the description of your app and how to use it. | Easy breezy markdown editing with [Mou](http://25.io/mou/), the markdown editor for developers. |
| Two associated models. | - |
| At least one Ruby Gem (Rails default gems don't count!). Some fun gems: | - Carrier Wave: easy file attachment, if you'd like to upload images. <br> - Twilio-gem: RESTful API to integrate sms into your app! <br> - FriendlyID: [fancy up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJcqs4C467Y&feature=youtu.be) your urls! <br> - ... | 
| Just one API. <br> *If you'd like to use more than one API, build your core MVP with one first, then add a second API as a feature.* | - Etsy: fancy shops! <br> - Spotify: tunes! <br> - Mapbox: easy maps! <br> - More on [Trello API Resources](https://trello.com/c/Lz7CTeUM/2-api-resources) |
| Let someone else handle your authentication: | Your application must utilize user login with an external auth service like Google, Github, or Twitter. <br> *Note: Facebook's auth makes for unhappy developers, so please use one listed* |
| Validations to handle invalid data. | Forms in your application should validate data and handle incorrect inputs. (i.e. validate sign up information, verify valid email addresses and secure passwords). |
| BEWDified with Bootstrap | Here are some free [Bootstrap Templates](http://startbootstrap.com), or style it up yourself. |
| Hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). | Set up an account as soon a possible. We'll go over this in class. Here's [dev documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails4#deploy-your-application-to-heroku). |


##DELIVERABLES
Your project will be deployed to Heroku and your source code will be submitted via GitHub. You will share the link for both with your instructor.

##BEST PRACTICES
The instructional team will provide feedback on how well you execute best practices. Even though it is not part of the requirements, you should keep these in mind. 

* Clean And Readable Code. The instructional team should be able to read and follow code easily.  Maintain clean and readable code including: consistent indentation, code commenting (e.g. when closing ```<div>``` tags, demarcating sections of code, describing possibly ambiguous code choices) and use proper and consistent naming conventions.

* RESTful. Implement some non-default (defaults are: add, create, update, destroy) RESTful routes to demonstrate your understanding of RESTful routing in Rails.


##GRADING
A project is considered satisfactory if it meets all core requirements. Anything extra is encouraged.
